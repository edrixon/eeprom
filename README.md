Arduino PROM programmer

Ed's programmer for 93c56 proms - really for use in programming old Maxon radios but can be used for anything.
PROMs must be connected in 16 bit mode

Tested with Arduino UNO but should work on anything
Arduino board determines maximum buffer size and so maximum prom size
Uno is good for a 1k buffer
